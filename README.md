## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While doing this project i could learn about the basic workflow in a **CSS** layout, the basics of text-styles, and in the same way the principles of using *flex*. While was working in this project i could understand better the process and reinforce my own knowledge.

Some code that i used:

```html
<div class="container">
      <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="image-qr-code">
      <div class="text">
        <h1 class="title-text">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
      </div>
```
```css
.container {
    max-width: 320px;
    max-height: 800px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: column;
    align-items: center;
    margin: auto;
    /* top | right | bottom | left */
    padding: 15px 1em 0 1em;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on developing my programming and design skills through the use of the different tools and programming languages that exist, like **HTML** , **CSS** , **JavaScript** , **Python** , **NodeJs** , **PL/SQL** .

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me for the first steps. I liked these documenting web technologies and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com) - This is an amazing collection of articles which helped me to understand **CSS** process. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning *CSS*.
